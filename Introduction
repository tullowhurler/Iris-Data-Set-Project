Introduction to Iris Data Set

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936 (1). 
Multivariate analysis involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time (2). 
This data set was first introduced as an example of linear discriminant analysis. 
Linear discriminant analysis is a form of statistical analysis that attempts to find a common theme or difference between 2 or more variables (3). 
This type of analysis has become extremely important in the development and amelioration of machine learning. 

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) (1). 
The data set comprises of 4 measurements of sample in centimetres, the length and width of both the petal and the sepal. 
Using these measurements Fisher used a linear discriminant model to try and discriminate each of the three species from each other. 

Based on Fisherâ€™s linear discriminant model the data set has become the standard for many statistical classification techniques, especially machine learning (4). 
Machine Learning is how a computer learns about new features and where and how they should be used. 
It involves pattern recognition and computational learning theory. 
Data classification is the process of organizing data into categories for its most effective and efficient use (5). 
In Machine Learning support machine vectors are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification(6). 

This data set is an important example as it highlights the important difference between supervised and unsupervised learning models for machine learning. 
The cluster analysis of the data shows two recognisable clusters however it cannot differentiate the three types of species unless they are labelled. 
The cluster analysis does not work as the 3 flowers from the same species appear as almost separate species due to the difference between the setosa being so different to the 2 others virginica and versicolor. 
Therefore, the three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) are separable by the unsupervising procedures of nonlinear principal component analysis (7).
I will through my own analysis break down the differences and similarities between each of the species in the data set.
